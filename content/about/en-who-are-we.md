Group of users of the statistical and programming language R in Málaga (Spain). 

Out aim is to build a community where to share knowledge and experiences, organize meetings and all types of activities, focused in learning all R capabilities. this group is completely open to scientists, professors, students, computer scientists, developers, data analysts, and everyone interested in using and developing in R. No previous skills required, everybody is welcome!!

Also, we love [_espetos_](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Espeto) :-)

We meet periodically to share interests, learn and collaborate. We also organize hackathons to develop useful R packages, as quick challenges to solve collaboratively during the session.

In addition, we have [twitter account](https://twitter.com/_RMlg), and a  [repository](https://github.com/orgs/RMalagaGroup) where we will store code, presentations, etc.

We adhere to the [R Consortium Code of Conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct).
